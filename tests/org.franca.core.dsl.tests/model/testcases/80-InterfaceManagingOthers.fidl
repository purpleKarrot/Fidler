<** @description : Another interface which manages several other interfaces. **>
interface RootInterface2 manages MyInterface1, MyInterface2, MyInterface3 {

<** @description: A managing interface which also extends from another.
    Note that this interface inherits also the manages-relation from its
    base interface, i.e., RootInterface3 also manages MyInterface1.
